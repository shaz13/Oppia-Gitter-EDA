**Number**** of Contributors dropping off:**

After analysing the channel data from the Gitter API it was found that there are **209 **active users since 2017. And, taking threshold of inactiveness for **218** days there are **105** dropped users which is about **50.24%** of total active users since 2017.

**Helping with new contributor**

* Whose helping most

* Ratio of helpers to askers

The contributors helping most were selected from the intersection of two lists. The first list was highest number of times they were **mentioned** and the second list is compiled from number of **times** they sent message. 

  

 

The intersected list of the top-30 users from two lists is as follows

['pranavsid98', 'seanlip', 'darthgera123', 'WickedBrat', 'Nix07', 'saeedjassani', 'mdew192837', 'kevinlee12', 'andromfins', 'anookeen', 'Arunabh98', 'rachelwchen', 'ashish3805', 'shaz13', 'DubeySandeep', 'cosmicAsymmetry', 'wxyxinyu', 'YimingPan', 'jaredsilver', 'shubha1593', '1995YogeshSharma', 'SudhanvaMG']

**Ratio of helpers to askers**

In progress. The ratio of number of questions to normal text chat is** 29.2%**

(Here, a **question** is defined as: â€¦)

**Chat responsiveness**

Responsiveness as of now is plotted as **readBy** (number count) of users vs **Day**. 

(E.g. the first bar means: 250 person-saw-a-message events were recorded on the first day of all twelve months of 2017.)
